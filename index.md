# Placeholder for my 'How-to' Raspberry Pi 3 Bramble

## Preface
This page explains how I put together the Raspberry Pi 3 Bramble. Because I didn't know any Linux command line when I first started, this 
recipe may sound condescendingly basic for anyone with basic Linux skills. However, I really want to keep the recipe as simple as possible to allow the most number of interested people to be able to replicate what I've done. 

Let me know of any typos or anything else you feel this recipe is missing. This document might be a work-in-progress for a little while. I'm open to constructive criticism.

## Supplies

Raspberry PI 3 B's: I used 4. I've seen clusters built with as few as 2. The sky's the limit if you want to do more.
USB Power Source: I used a 5-port power source. Just make sure your power source is a minimum of 2.5 amps per port. More on this later.
