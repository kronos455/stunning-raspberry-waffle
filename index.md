# Placeholder for my 'How-to' Raspberry Pi 3 Bramble

## Preface
This page explains how I put together the Raspberry Pi 3 Bramble. Because I didn't know any Linux command line when I first started, this 
recipe may sound condescendingly basic for anyone with basic Linux skills. However, I really want to keep the recipe as simple as possible to allow the most number of interested people to be able to replicate what I've done. 

I will assume that the reader can operate a computer or can ask a friend for help.

Let me know of any typos or anything else you feel this recipe is missing. This document might be a work-in-progress for a little while. I'm open to constructive criticism. I'll put some pics in as well at a later date. I realize that this page, as is, is as bland as toast.

## Components

--> Raspberry PI 3 B's: I used 4. I've seen clusters built with as few as 2. The sky's the limit if you want to do more. I also refer to these as 'RP3B' because typing more than I have to seem inefficient.

--> USB Power Source: I used a 5-port power source. Just make sure your power source is a minimum of 2.5 amps per port (the power source sold seperately for the RP3B is 5 amp). More on this later.

--> A router: I used a basic, 5-port router to start. It was cheap. Then I was invited present the cluster to some folks at the university I attend for my Master's and I needed a wireless to make the cluster remotely. It's up to you.

--> 32 GB Micro SD cards: I had 4 Raspberry PI's so I bought 4 Micro SD Cards. You can go small or big on the disk volume, depending on your intended use, however, I would HIGHLY recommend Class 10 or above if possible. The higher the class, the faster the read & write speeds. I noticed that the Class 10's were significantly faster than the Class 4's I started out with.

--> Micro USB cables: You'll need 4. I liked the flat ones. Makes it easy to aesthetically manage the cables. 
Sources: http://amzn.to/2oznxwD

--> Ethernet Patch Cables: You'll need 4. These are flat, too. 
Sources: http://amzn.to/2oFYCnW

--> Electrical Strip: Need one to plug in your power source and router. Out of caution, I bought one that had some surge protection and an accompanying guarantee. They are a little more expensive but they make you feel like you're protecting your newly acquired toy during a thunder-storm.

--> USB Fan: Just for fun.

--> Acrylic, Stacked Case: Gives a nice presentation of the cluster.

This is how I assembled the cluster. Feel free to get artistic. Just keep in mind that there are certain thing that you can't change - each RP3B absolutely needs 2.5 amps or more power, etc. And this isn't an endorsement of Amazon but they do make things easier.

## Citing Sources

I did not make this cluster in a vacuum. I don't have the technical background necessary to "wing it". However, with the right instruction just about anyone can get started and learn. I had no background in Linux so it took me about a month to get the cluster working the first time.

All of these pages were useful in that they helped me put the pieces together to install Apache Hadoop 2.7.2. Maybe it was my inexperience at the time, but it felt as I wouldn't have been able to complete the project with only one of those pages alone.

I spent the most time with the page at http://www.widriksson.com/raspberry-pi-hadoop-cluster/#The_setup.

## The Setup 

Download Raspbian Jessie Lite (RP3B recommended OS) from Github user caiomsouza: https://github.com/caiomsouza/raspberrypi/releases. This is an older release of Jessie but it worked well with this project. I would recommend enabling SSH & password protect your RP3B immediately as soon as you power those puppies up and plug them into your network. Seems like nefarious characters hijack IOT devices for their nefarious purposes.

### A Single Node

We're going to start this project with a single node. My advisors at school always encourage me to get my ideas working first then scale later.

So that's what we're going to do.

Here's a tutorial of how to get the OS onto the MicroSD card: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md

If you're lucky enough to own a Mac, as I am, you can use ApplePi Baker, which is an easy and nifty program to put the OS image onto the MicroSD card. https://www.tweaking4all.com/news/applepi-baker-v1-9-1-update/

Once you have prepped the MicroSD card with the OS, with the power off, you'll insert it into the RP3B motherboard. That slot is on the front (as opposed to the back where the USB & ethernet ports are).

Power on the RP3B. 

Once that's powered on, you'll need to find the IP address of the RP3B. You can do that by logging onto your router and looking for the new device. The router's IP address is usually something like 192.168.x.x. Unless you've changed it or this is printed on the bottom or side of the router, the username is usually admin and password is usually password.

One more note: Let's say you have a cable modem/router. Then you probably took the router that you plugged the RP3B into and plugged that into the cable modem/router. That's not a problem but you'll just need to remember (write it down) the IP address of both.

Then, if you have Windows you'll use Putty (https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client-download), you'll open up the terminal and SSH into the RP3B device.

This is going to look something like this:

```markdown
kronos455s-computer:~ kronos455$ ssh pi@192.168.x.x ##This is your command line. 'pi' is the user name. 
                                                    ##You'll be asked the password next. It was 'raspberry' 
                                                    ##for me.
```
For the novice, you'll only use the `ssh pi@192.168.x.x` after the dollar sign. It could be a hash sign as well. Putty is a bit different in that you'll open Putty, select SSH, enter the username `pi`, enter the address `192.168.x.x`, and enter the password `raspberry`.

Once you login and enter the password successfully, you'll be asked to accept a certificate as an added security precaution. Accept it. This will keep keep someone else from being able to use that card in another device. This will be an issue later on in the recipe when you replicate the single-node image in order to set up the cluster. But this is fine. There is a work around. 

Now that you've successfully logged in, you'll configure the RP3B.

That's done by using the following command:

` sudo raspi-config `

Go through the setup and ensure the following configuration or adjust it to your choice:

- Expand SD card
- Set password
- Choose console login
- Chose keyboard layout and locales
- Overclocking, High, 900MHz CPU, 250MHz Core, 450MHz SDRAM (If you do any voltmodding ensure you have a good power supply for the PI)
- Under advanced options:
- --> Hostname: master //I called mine master.
- --> Memory split: 16mb
- --> Enable SSH Server
- --> Restart the PI.

Install a text editor of your choice. I like Nano for the beginner. If you have Raspbian Jessie Lite installed you can do that with this little bit of code:

` sudo apt-get install nano `

Edit as root or with sudo:
/etc/network/interfaces

` sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf`

At the bottom of the file add:

```markdown
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.x.x ## IP address of your RP3B
netmask 255.255.255.0 ## This is usually the same on most routers. Check yours to make sure.
gateway: 192.168.0.1 ## This is the address of the router that you plug the RP3B directly into. 
static domain_name_servers=123.123.123.123 123.123.123.123 ##change this to whatever is showing
                                                           ##as the DNS on your router. 
```

### Update system and install Oracle Java

`sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-jdk`

Run _*update-alternatives*_, ensure *_jdk-8-oracle-xxx_* is selected:

`sudo update-alternatives --config java`

### Configure Hadoop user

Create a new user for use with Hadoop:
```
sudo addgroup hadoop
sudo adduser --ingroup hadoop hduser
sudo adduser hduser sudo
```
Create SSH paris keys with blank password. This will enable nodes to communicate with each other in the cluster.

```
su hduser
mkdir ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ""
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Login into `localhost` as hduser (answer yes when prompted to trust certificate key â€“ otherwise Hadoop will fail to login later)

```
su hduser
ssh localhost
exit
```
Or, if you kind of know what you're doing in Linux, just do all of this from the user root. I found it easier (it's not more secure, though).

### Compile Native Hadoop 2.7.2 for Raspberry PI (ARM)

Ensure you have logged out as hduser and logged in as pi user. (for sudo command below to work properly)

Install protobuf 2.5.0

This is required to build Hadoop.
```
sudo wget https://protobuf.googlecode.com/files/protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz
sudo wget https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v2.5.0/protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz
sudo tar xzvf protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz
cd protobuf-2.5.0
./configure --prefix=/usr
make; make check; sudo make install
```
